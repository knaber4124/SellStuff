sell_stuff is a basic Point of Sale app

This will allow you to create an "owner" profile when first subscribing. The owner will then be able to create "manager" and "agent" profiles with varying capabilities.

The app features various capabilities such as the actual point of sale functionality but also inventory management, sales metrics, and user management.

Currently this will not support actual payment methods but could be expanded to do so.
